        <p className="mb-3">
        G'day! I'm Jayden, a fresh ICT graduate with a major in <span className="font-medium">Information and Technology</span>. 
        I previously completed minors in <span className="font-medium">Management Information Systems</span> and <span className="font-medium">Advertising Technologies</span>. 
        Currently working as an IT Specialist at Caleb & Brown, where I'm getting hands-on experience with cybersecurity, system administration, and automation. I'm always keen to learn new tech as I've been working with <span className="font-medium">JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, Python, Bash scripting, JumpCloud, and various cybersecurity tools</span>, basically anything that helps me grow in the IT field!
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3">
        During my studies, I worked a fair dinkum variety of part-time jobs to support myself. I started out washing dishes, then moved up to kitchen hand work, before getting into food and beverage roles at <span className="font-medium">Chatime and Delaware North stadiums</span>. 
        From there, I transitioned into retail at <span className="font-medium">Sunglass Hut</span> and even did some coaching work. Each of these jobs taught me something different - from working under pressure in busy kitchens to delivering great customer service in retail, and developing communication skills through coaching. 
        It's been quite the journey, and I reckon all these experiences have made me more well-rounded and better at working with people from all walks of life.
        </p>

        <p>
        <span className="font-medium">A bit about me personally: </span> I speak <span className="font-medium">English, Mandarin, Malay, and Cantonese</span> â€” perks of growing up with <span className="underline">Malaysian</span> heritage! Outside of work and coding, I'm into <span className="italic">dancing, catching films, and taking photos</span> (always on the hunt for that perfect shot). 
        I am eager to learn, ready to tackle challenges, and hopefully, make my <span className="underline">mark</span> in the IT world!
